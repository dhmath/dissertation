# Dissertation

These are the algorithms I used for the computations in my PhD research on Littlewood's conjecture (in simultaneous Diophantine approximation).

LW.nb is a Mathematica (version 8.0) notebook. I've been rewriting these algorithms in Python, and when I'm finished with that I'll put it up here too.

# Notes

The first few functions (mod1, LWNorm, LWProd, SqrtMod1) are for calculations related to Littlewood's conjecture.

The rest are functions that set up a number field K=Q(theta) (represented by a matrix ring of the form Q[T] for a special matrix T), perform arithmetic in K using matrix operations, or are related to simultaneous approximations of powers of theta.
